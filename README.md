# World Cup 2022 Simulator
 
A basic simulator that simulates all the matches of the World Cup. You have no control over the outcome, you can just hit play and watch the scores as they simulate.

During the setup, it allows either the 2022 groups or completely random groups.

Each match is simulated in 2 seconds. Theres no extra time, currently just goes straight to penalties in the knockout stages. The stats for each match are limited, but there is a statistics table to give a little more information on the current tournament.
